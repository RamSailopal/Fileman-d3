The primary key is the principal means of identifyingrecords in the file. To allow FileMan to enforce key uniqueness, the database designer mustdefine a regular index that consists of all the fields that make up thekey. This index is called the uniqueness index. All key fields must have values. They cannot be null."

In addition, the file should NEVER beedited using FileMan. These are both DEA requirements. In order to satisfy the requirement that both the prescribing (CPRS) and filling systems (Outpatient Pharmacy) create an archive, but to reduce the need for additional storage space, both CPRS and Pharmacy will use the same file. CPRS will create the entries when an order is signed or when a backdoor order message is received from Pharmacy. Once Pharmacy verifies the data in the Pharmacy system is an exact match for what CPRS stored, they will subscribe to the entry in the archive file and will update the PRESCRIPTION NUMBER (#1) field. The file was defined in a different global name in order to handle the volume set from the rest of the CPRS system (i.e., the ORDER file).It is important to note that to fully meet the DEA requirements, the fields required by the DEA cannot be pointers. We must store the data completely. The fields that are pointers are for our internal use, rather than for the DEA purposes."

A wizard helps the user construct the criteria used in thequery. This file contains definitions of queries used to build reports of CPRSitems (orders, consults, documents).  Each query definition contains alist of constraints.  These constraints are used by the query routines toreturn a subset of CPRS items. This file also contains definitions of report criteria.  These criteria are selected and modified by the user when building custom reports.  Areport criterion contains a list of constraints that apply to theparticular criterion. A critieron behaves much like a ""mini-report"". The other part of a query definition stored in this file is the list offields to be displayed after the query is run.

The ""AT"" indexhas this structure:  equivalent ucis on different volume sets.  The ""AV"" index has thisstructure: certain uci is part of a certain volume set. Whenever the VOLUME SET field of the VOLUME SET file is changed, aMUMPS cross-reference searches through this file and re-cross-referencesall pointers to that entry, thereby keeping the two files in synch."

142.98,HEALTH SUMMARY USER PREFERENCES,,
142.99,HEALTH SUMMARY PARAMETERS,,"This file contains any site parameters which may apply to the HealthSummary package."
15,DUPLICATE RECORD,,"This file contains information about duplicate records in any file definedin the two variable pointer fields; RECORD1 and RECORD2 (.01 and .02).  Thestatus of an entry in this file may be 'potential duplicate, unverified','verified, not a duplicate', or 'verified duplicate'. The envisioned sequence of events is software would identify potentialduplicates from a file and add an entry in this file containing the twopotential duplicate records and set the status field to 'potentialduplicate, unverified'.  A user would then make the determination of whetherthe two entries were truely duplicates and change the status fieldappropriately. If the user changed the status to 'verified duplicate' he/she would thenbe asked whether to merge RECORD1 to RECORD2 or RECORD2 to RECORD1.  Therecords would then be merged accordingly. This user interaction is controlled by the merge software and the dictionarysupports a merge methodology that will notify the appropriate packagesaffected by the merging of the two entries and wait for their concurrenceprior to actually merging the two entries.  If this approach is not desiredthe software can set the appropriate fields and immediatley do the merge.This methodology requires the two fields defined below. The MERGE STATUS field is a SET where 0=not ready, 1=ready, and 2=merged.This field would be set to 0=not ready and a bulletin would be sent tothe appropriate package users. The MERGE PACKAGES field is a multiple which contains a list of packagesthat are affected by the merging of entries in the subject file.  TheSTATUS field of this multiple will be set to 0=not ready if the packagehas the 'from' entry and does an interactive merge.  It will be set to1=ready if the package has the 'from' entry but does an automatic merge.It will be set to 2=no from entry if the package does not have the 'from'entry, regardless of whether they do an interactive or automatic merge.If the package has a merge routine in the package file the merge isautomatic.  If not, the merge is interactive.  The ERROR MESSAGE field ofthis multiple will contain any errors encountered during the execution ofthat packages merge routine. Once all entries in the MERGE PACKAGES multiple have a STATUS'=0 the MERGESTATUS field is set to 1=ready via a TRIGGER. Once the MERGE STATUS is set to 1=ready the actual merge will occur.  Whenit is complete the MERGE STATUS will be set to 2=merged.  Once set to 2most fields cannot be modified. The following fields are set by TRIGGERs and are never seen by the user:DATE FOUND, DATE VERIFIED, DATE RESOLVED, WHO CREATED, WHO VERIFIED,and WHO CHANGED.  Also, the MERGE DIRECTION and MERGE STATUS fields will bedeleted by a TRIGGER if the STATUS field is modified from 'verifiedduplicate' to any other status. The fields LOOKUP1 and LOOKUP2 provide navigational capability from thisfile to either the RECORD1 or RECORD2 entries in the file specified inthe variable pointer fields.  The field LOOKUP3 provides navigationalcapability to any file that points to this file and has a DINUMrelationship. A lookup on the ""B"" xref will get any file entry that is part of a duplicaterecord pair because the ""B"" xref is set by a REGULAR xref on the .01 fieldand by a MNEMONIC xref on the .02 field. The ""AFR"" xref is used by the INPUT TRANSFORMS on the .01 and .02 field toprevent entering a file entry that has already been merged away. All xrefs that have subscripts consisting of 'RECORD'low DFN The ""ALK"" xref is short lived and contains entries that are unresolvedpotential duplicates or verified duplicates that have not yet been merged.Its form, using file 2 as an example, is or following meaning: 1=potential duplicate, 2=verified duplicate.  When the5th subscript is a 1 there will be two ""ALK"" entries with the two fe#sreversed.  When the 5th subscript is a 2 there will be only 1 ""ALK"" entryand fe#s will be in the order 'from' 'to'.  Once merged the ""ALK"" xreffor that entry will be killed. The ""AMRG"" xref is also short lived and contains one ""AMRG"" entry foreach entry in this file that has a MERGE STATUS of 0=not ready or1=ready.  Once merged the ""AMRG"" xref for that entry will be killed.The form of the ""AMRG xref, using file 2 as an example, isof the 4th subscript has the following meaning; 0=not ready, 1=ready. The ""AVCHG"" xref is set by the WHO CHANGED field which is itself only setwhen the STATUS field is changed from ""V"" to any other value.  If this xrefexists action needs to be taken because other packages have been notifiedto merge the two entries. All TRIGGERs fire forward except the TRIGGER on the STATUS field of theMERGE PACKAGES multiple which fires backward to set the MERGE STATUS field.However, that TRIGGER has no effect on the kill side.  TRIGGER direction canbe relevent when deleting entries using  The .01 and .02 fields are 'uneditable' so entries can only be deleted fromthis file using  Most TRIGGERs will not fire during a RE-INDEX of this file.  Also, manyare conditional upon external SET values.  Modify this dictionary withextreme caution. Several TRIGGERs have been modified using the conditional logic to prevent firing during a RE-INDEX.  This was doneonly for TRIGGERs that already had human readable conditional logic. ***** W A R N I N G *****When you add a file to a variable pointer field FileMan deletes theinput transform so save it off before the change and restore it afterthe change."

The STATUS field of this multiple will be setto 0=NOT READY if the package has the 'from' entry in the subject fileand does not have a merge routine specified in the package file.  TheSTATUS field will be set to 1=READY if the package has the 'from' entryand also has a merge routine specified in the package file.

190100.1,CLINICAL RULE,,"The Clinical Rule file describes all the rules follows by the Clinical Event Monitor. Each rule describes a clinical condition that might ariseand what the monitor should do about it when it does. This file is used mainly by the Clinical Event Processor option [AXVM CLINICAL EVENT PROCESSOR], which runs as a persistent task. AXVM protocolsrun whenever the events we're monitoring occur. These protocols send HL7messages to the processor describing each event. The processor loads eachmessage and runs it through the rules in this file, each of which teststhe event and takes action if it meets that rule's criteria. The rules are implemented in a partially table-driven manner in whicheasy-and-efficient-to-represent rule data is put in this file, and anything trickier is hard-coded into routines, one per rule, that describethe rule and use the data from this file to properly test for and respondto the conditions in question. An option is also created for each rulethat involves lists the users need to manage. Although this file couldhave been designed to represent all parts of the rules so that specialroutines were not needed, the sheer number of message processed per daymakes efficiency important, so we compromised. Rick Marshall created the Clinical Rule file at Puget Sound VAHCS on June 13, 2002 for Clinical Event Monitor version 2.0."

During theconversion of the Clinical Event Monitor to MUMPS, he was able to retireenough of the parameters that even just having the two remainingparameters together on one node was a big improvement."

This file will have a break down byindividual teeth and procedures that were used to create the record.These file entries will be created by the Document Storage Systems (DSS)Dental-GUI application.  The purpose of that application is to allow thecreation of records in this file.  But at the same time, it will createPCE workload entries and will also create a record in the Dental ActivitySystem (DAS) file (221).  This has the following advantages:  1. The DSS-GUI has one user interface for inputting data 2. The need for the dental card reader should be eliminatedA.  The cardreader should be kept for backup purposes 3. The dentist and assistants won't need to go into VistA PCE options torecord their workload 4. The dentists can do their Progress Note in the DSS-GUI which willdownload it to the VistA TIU package."

It is exported with data. All sites must have entriesfor the data types distributed in order to display objects sent viamultimedia mail. The Object Type file handles objects of various types.  These include:   * still images   * image groups  * graphics or waveforms  * scanned documents  * audio files    Other types are expected in the future (i.e., image overlays,motion video chips, and office automation files).  An object,such as an image series, may actually consist of multipleobjects.  In this case, the object type is Group.  The ObjectGroup multiple field is used to point to a set of objects in theImage file.  Each object type has associated methods (softwareroutines) for performing certain actions.  For example, there aremethods for displaying images and image abstracts.  The grouptype is used to combine multiple objects of the same or differenttypes to create complex objects.  There are different image types, for example:   * black and white high-resolution x-rays  * black and white ultrasound images (lower resolution)  * pseudo-color nuclear medicine scans  * medium resolution true color bronchoscopy images  * pathology images  Each type of object has a number of specific characteristics,including the methods  required to display them.  For example,each object type has a type name and an associated display methodor window.  All accesses to objects use the file finder routine points of this routine will find locations of full files,abstract files, and jukebox copies of files.  In addition, thenetwork write location will be returned for image captures."

Using these fields along with thePARENT DATA FILE, backward navigation is possible whether it be to amultiple of a file, or a multiple of a sub-file of a file. Each image thatis captured is associated with a procedure or test report.  Depending onthe service collecting the image, different types of reports will beassociated.  For example:   * Medical Procedures:  Endoscopy, Dermatology, Hematology, Rheumatology, etc.  * Anatomic Pathology:  Surgical Pathology, Cytology, Autopsy, Electron Microscopy  * Radiology:  Xray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound  * Surgery  Operation reports  * Text Integration Utility  Progress notes  In order to be able to display information from the associatedreport, references to that report are stored in the Image file. One of these references is a pointer to the Parent Report file(2005.03), which contains an entry for each package's report filethat is currently supported."

This file maps logical devicenames to physical device names, allowing continued operation even whennetwork storage devices are done. The Imaging site parameters has a numberof fields pointing to this file to locate where on the network differentfiles are written. Because the Imaging System operates in a distributedenvironment, an object may be stored on one or more of the network storagedevices.  These include multiple magnetic file servers, one or moreoptical jukeboxes, and possibly additional network devices accessedthrough a gateway.  Each logical location in the Network Location file is mapped to aphysical device.  Every physical device on the network that will be usedfor objects must have at least one entry in the Network Location file.  The Operational Status field allows rapid software reconfiguration in theevent of failure of one of the object storage devices.  Each network storage device has a type, such as magnetic or optical.This allows ""automatic file migration,"" where an object resides on a fastmagnetic disk until 30 days since its last access, then it is moved toslower, less expensive optical media.  Three fields in the Image file (2005) are used to indicate the storagedevice(s) on which the object resides.  For example, an object mayoriginally be captured to MAG1, the first magnetic server.  Withinseconds, an abstract is created and stored on this same device; the Disk &Vol, Abstract field will be set to MAG1 also.  Next, the Image file willbe copied to the optical jukebox (if present on the network), creating animmediate backup copy.  The Disk & Vol, Optical field will now be set topoint to the optical device used for the optical copy.  The Network Location file was designed to allow access across a gateway.This type of access has not been required at the test sites.  We recommend using names for magnetic devices that begin with the threeletters, MAG, followed by sequential numbers.  We recommend that images bestored in directories named IMAGE at the first level.  Do not store anyfiles in this directory that are not objects handled by File 2005.  Logical names for Write Once Read Many (WORM) optical devices shouldstart with the four letters, WORM."

EXPORT ---- copy an image to an export directory so that it can be usedoutside the imaging system 3. IMPORT ----copy an image from an import directory into the imaging system 4. JUKEBOX ---copy an image from hard disk to the jukebox 5. JBTOHD ----copy an image from the jukebox to the hard disk There is a single Input Queue file for all the requests, with across-reference to request type.  The background processor processes theentries in a prioritized first-in first-out fashion, and uses the QueuePointer file to record its progress. The background processor uses theJukebox file for device-specific information.  The jukebox platters arelogically placed into the Network Location file, and are pointed to by theJukebox file and the Image file.  Jukeboxes, which can be configured as asingle volume, only have a single entry in the network location file."

They can be inactivated, or ""logically deleted"", but only if no artifact descriptors are pointing to them. They can never be physically deleted, since there are artifacts that still point to the old retention policies, and we need to keep the historical record of retention policies that have been applied to this artifact over time. Business retention policies are designed to be called by business code for certain patients (e.g., Agent Orange retention policy, Employee retention policy, etc.). These retention policies will be installed with the patch and can be ""replaced"" with updated versions, but not deleted, since business logic will presumably expect to find them."

The purpose of that application is to allow thecreation of records in this file.  But at the same time, it will createPCE workload entries and will also create a record in the Dental ActivitySystem (DAS) file (221).  This has the following advantages:  1. The DSS-GUI has one user interface for inputting data 2. The need for the dental card reader should be eliminated.  The cardreader should be kept for backup purposes 3. The dentist and assistants won't need to go into VistA PCE options torecord their workload 4.

4.302,PURGE AUDIT,4.3,"This multiple contains a history of Message file purges.  Generally,a record of the last 20 purges is kept.MailMan has two ways to purge messages.  The option XMAUTOPURGE is generallyrun after XMCLEAN (the waste basket cleaner) and will purge any messagesthat are not pointed at by any recipients nor the sender.  The optionXMPURGE-BY-DATE can also be run to purge messages that have an originationdate older than one used to initiate the process.  It is recommended that before XMPURGE-BY-DATE is used, users be notified of the proposed purge date so they have a chance to preserve important texts.  These are the only options that actually kill off entries in the message file.  The XMPURGE option does the same thing as XMAUTOPURGE, but is meant to be run in foreground and displays data as it proceeds. Unlike XMPURGE and XMAUTOPURGE, which only remove messages that no one holds in their mail baskets any more, XMPURGE-BY-DATE will remove messages fromusers' mail baskets and then delete them from the message file (3.9)."

Becausethe RAI/MDS interface is triggered by PIMS ADT events, there is no PIMSevent for this discharge.  In fact, the PIMS software creates a pseudodischarge at the time the patient goes on ASIH with a date/time of NOWplus 30 days.  Therefore, if the 30 days is exceeded, the discharge goesinto affect.  If the patient returns or dies while ASIH, the discharge iseither deleted or modified.In order to maintain control of the patients on ASIH, a new file wascreated.  In addition, a routine which will periodically run checking theentries for patients who have exceeded the 30 day stay.  Whenever a stayis found to exceed the 30 days, an HL7 Discharge (A03) will be created andsent to the COTS system and the entry in the RAI MDS ASIH PATIENT filewill be inactivated.

With it you make entries into a personal calendar, place an item on a general to-do list, or have an entry be part of both.  A Calendar entry is entered for a given date and can optionally be given a time of day and duration.  Calendar features include:     Day, Week, and Month displays     Edit, View, List, and Print Calendar or To-Do entries     Six month planner display  Calendar also has an Index Card function for entry and retrieval of whatever information you wish to store. ;Summary of Functions  DAY DISPLAY      For the current day, or a day you select, a calendar, list of events,      and a time matrix for appointments with a duration entered. WEEK DISPLAY      Enter any date and a Sunday thru Saturday display is given showing a      time matrix for each day and entry keywords for each day of the week. MONTH DISPLAY      For the month you specify, a count of each entries per day. EDIT ENTRY      To enter or edit either a calendar or to-do list entry. VIEW      To view a single calendar/to-do entry or in 'loop' mode review all      entries in your file for possible edit or purging. LIST and PRINT      Provides an abbreviated screen display of your calendar/to-do entries      or allows a printed list of either. SIX MONTH PLANNER      A six month calendar display for planning purposes. INDEX CARD      A non-calendar area for general information storage. ;Miscellaneous Functions   SETUP      Provides user access to certain calendar parameters. ASSUME SURROGATE      Allows a user to change their calendar identity, if permitted. PURGE ENTRIES      Provides a quick way to clean and manage their calendar database.   Even though there are two menu lines, you can select most functions from either one.    There is additional on-line help available at both menu select prompts, accessible by entering  ?  or  ??  or  ???  at either menu line. ;Day Display     On entry into Calendar, you are given the 'Day' display for the current date. The display contains a monthly calendar for the day being viewed, a list of entries for the day, and a time matrix showing any time blocks marked out for appointments or whatever.  An entry in your calendar may be:      - something to be done or be remembered that day and thus not have any        time associated with it      - an event on that day at a specific time      - an event with a time and duration      - an entry for a date in the future which you've specified to be displayed        early      - an entry for the a date past which you've specified to be displayed        daily until changed or deleted   Enter two question marks  ??  at the main menu to see help text on various ways to specify the day you would like displayed. ;Sample Day Display   Calendar for  John Schmidt                             Today is  AUG 22,1989 =============================================================================       AUG 1989      || Memos for  TODAY!

When you add a new entry it is by default for your calendar unless you specify otherwise.  The following rules determine whether an entry is considered part of your calendar or to-do list:  a) An entry with a DATE FOR CALENDAR is for your calendar. b) An entry without a date is a to-do list item. c) If an entry has both a DATE FOR CALENDAR and a TO-DO LIST PRIORITY,    is a to-do item with a due date.  A priority for a to-do item is    usually optional unless the entry is also to appear on your calendar,    then it's required.  If you edit an existing entry, the above rules will determine the field order you will be prompted with. ;Entry Fields  DESCRIPTION      2-40 characters describing your calendar or to-do list entry. DATE FOR CALENDAR      Date of the event for your calendar.  You may optionally enter a time if      desired.  Question this prompt for a display of valid date and time      formats that you may enter.  If you enter a date without the year, future      is assumed.  See 'Enhanced DATE entry' screen for the various ways      a date can be entered. KEYWORD FOR WEEK DISPLAY      2-10 characters for the week display that will remind you of this memo.      The memo entry is cross-referenced by both keyword and description for      easier retrieval. LENGTH OF APPOINTMENT      If your memo date has a time, and you want to block out your time matrix      to show an appointment time and length then you may enter the length here      in minutes.  You may use the letter H to designate hours (90 minutes could      be entered 1.5H).  If an entry blocks the entire day (holiday, vacation      etc) you can enter an asterisk '*' to replace the time matrix with the      entry subject text. ;Entry Fields (continued)   ADVANCE DISPLAY WINDOW      A memo you enter will display on the day you specify for calendar date.      This field is to specify how many days, if any, in advance of that date      you want to start seeing the memo appear on your day display. ALWAYS DISPLAY AFTER DATE PASSES      This is good for reminders that should be displayed until taken care of,      even if you don't get to it on the day you initially set up for display.      You may have reports due on the first day of the month, but you need to be      reminded of them until completed, regardless of the day. NOTES      This is a FileMan word processing field for any additional notes you want      to enter. TO-DO LIST PRIORITY      If an entry is for your calenda"

Speech Recognition Score:    Maryland CNC word list ______% right ear _____% left ear  3. When only pure tone results should be used to evaluate hearing     loss, the examiner, who must be a state-licensed audiologist, should      certify that language difficulties or other problems (specify what     the problems are) make the combined use of pure tone average and    speech discrimination inappropriate."

For type of    loss, indicate whether it is normal, conductive, sensorineural,    central, or mixed.  For degree, indicate whether it is mild (26-40 dB    HL), moderate (41-54 dB HL), moderately-severe (55-69 dB HL), severe    (70-89  dB HL), or profound (90+ dB HL). For VA purposes, impaired    hearing is considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold    in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz is 40 dB    HL or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of    these frequencies are 26 dB HL or greater; or when speech recognition    scores are less than 94%.  2.

The Inpatient Medications Requirements for the Special Focus GroupIRA - Phase III project will prevent users from entering free textschedules for inpatient medication orders. This patch helps accomplishthis by changing the validation of schedules. In Inpatient MedicationsV.5.0, the SCHEDULE field (#8) of the ORDERABLE ITEM multiple (#2) of theUNIT DOSE ORDER SET file (#53.2), has been changed to a pointer, ratherthan a free-text field.

If test resultsare being entered or reviewed for verification on a test that has an entryin the 'Type of delta check' field for that site/specimen then the code inthe DELTA CHECK file is executed.  Usually the delta check is used to promptback to the technologist a warning that there is some inconsistency in thedata, so that the data can be rechecked before it is verified.  Delta checkscan be used for other reasons such as skipping over entries that do notneed to be prompted or for doing calulations on data and storing thecalculated results."

62.483,REMOTE SYSTEM ID,62.48,"This field is used to locate the correct configuration in this file whena message is received from a remote system. Most messaging protocolscontain information about the system that originated the message and thesystem that is the destination. Since there can be several senders andreceivers, this field can be used to determine the correct receiver byusing a special lookup on this field. The Universal Interface utilizesthis field in the following manner. The VISTA Health Level Seven (HL7) package requires that every messagemust have four fields in the message header so that it can determinethe application route for the message. Those four fields are calledSending Application, Sending Facility, Receiving Application, andReceiving Facility. The HL7 software must find values for each of thesefields in the message within the HL7 package files. The fields must matchin the following way. For HL7 v1.5 interfaces Sending Application = the NAME field (#.01) in  the HL7 NON-DHCP  APPLICATION PARAMETER file (#770) Sending Facility = the NON-DHCP FACILITY NAME field (#3) in File 770 Receiving Application = the NAME field (#.01) in the HL7 APPLICATION  PARAMETER file (#771) Receiving Facility = the DHCP STATION NUMBER field (#2) in File 770  For HL7 v1.6 interfaces Sending Application = the NAME field (#.01) in the HL7 APPLICATION   PARAMETER file (#771) Sending Facility = the FACILITY NAME field (#3) in File 771 Receiving Application = the NAME field (#.01) in the HL7 APPLICATION    PARAMETER file (#771) Receiving Facility = the FACILITY NAME field (#3) in File 771 For the Universal Interface, all four of those fields should be enteredinto this multiple field, exactly as they are entered in the HL7 fieldslisted above, including upper and lower case characters. No spaces shouldbe entered between the field values. An example of a Universal Interfacevalue for this field is listed below.LAB INTERFACEInstrument ManagerLA AUTO INST695 Where LAB INTERFACE is the NAME in File 770, Instrument Manager isthe NON-DHCP FACILITY NAME in File 770, LA AUTO INST is the NAME inFile 771, and 695 is the DHCP STATION NUMBER in File 770. When an HL7 message comes in, these four fields are taken out of themessage, concatenated together, and a lookup is done on the ""C"" crossreference to find this configuration and its associated parameters. Theprocessing routine can then continue to process the data. "

The main VistA facility then needs to place this specimen/test on another shipping configuration manifest to ship to another laboratory. By designating the feeder shipping configuration this test will only be added to the manifest if it has been received by the laboratory via a manifest related to the feeder shipping configuration.  If the manifest related to the feeder shipping configuration has not been received then the test will not be added to prevent it being placed on a manifest before the specimen has arrived."

Originally, this file wasnamed DSM-III-R MODIFIERS, had 36 entries, and was used exclusivelyfor DSM-III-R purposes.  When the DSM-IV software was created,this file was renamed, generically, to DSM MODIFIERS.   When the DSM-IV modifiers were released, the following was true:  1.  The 36 entries in the original DSM-III-R MODIFIERS file were      identical to the first 36 entries in the DSM-IV modifiers.  2.  Entries after 37, were not present in the      DSM-III-R MODIFIERS file; they were truly new, unique entries. When the DSM-IV modifiers were released the following changes were made to the file:  1.  The PROMPT field (#1) was changed from 200 to 230 characters  2.  The file name was changed as noted above  3.  The file description was changed.  4.  A new multiple field - DSM VERSION - was added to the DSM       MODIFIERS file.  It was assigned field number 4.  The purpose      of this field was to track the versions by which each modifier      entry was used.  (Therefore, the first 36 entries have two      entries in this multiple:  DSM-III-R and DSM-IV.  And, the entries      unique to DSM-IV, entries after 37, have one entry in the       multiple: DSM-IV.)"

663037,PROGRAMMER TASKS,,"Programming Tasks file tied to TASKS.EXE Delphi utility.The intent of this project is to allow a programmer to: A.  Pick up a list of his/her tasks from Class III file 663990    [PROGRAMMER TASKS]    These task may coincide with an IRM Workorder, but need not do so. B.  Be able to add a new task to the file along with the following    information       1) Task Name (up to 50 characters)       2) Task ID (up to 10 characters]            a) May be IRM WorkOrder # if desired, but at this time                there field is FREE TEXT and is not associated with                a pointer to that, or any other, file.            b) Suggest each programmer us a common numbering scheme                so his/her TASK ID numbers will be recognizable              (eg. ARKCxxxxx)       3) Date Task Assigned / Begun       4) Enter a complete task description in the provided word processing          field.  This description is entered at the TASK DESCRIPTION TAB          and may be edited and re-saved at any time. C.  With a single click of a task in the task list be able to     1)  Display all the information in B above     2)  Also display all previous notes on this task in date/time-of-entry         order.   D.  With single click of the Session Open/Close button be able to open a    new session for a given task.     1) You cannot open a new session if one is active (can only work on        one task at a time).  This is set up so that actual working time        on any task can be calculated.     2) Opening a session will set the date/time toggle for this session     3) Opening the session begins a new Note headed with the Date/Time        Stamp.  No note text need be added - in which case the note will        contain only the beginning and ending timestamp of the session.  E.  Upcomming options to be added     A.  Sort tasks by         TASK ID         TASK SHORT DESCRIPTION         within those categories         ALL         COMPLETED         OPEN         NOIS'd     B.  Be able to push a button to see times spent by task for the day     C.  Display total time spent on any task to date     D.  Print all data on a Task to a file     E.  Purge a task (?? automatically print to file before purging??)     F.  Print a task to a file"

663093,USERGUIDE,," ;INTRODUCTION TO D.H.C.P.    Welcome to (D)ecentralized (H)ospital (C)omputer (P)rograms !!     DHCP consists of 6000 options, is written in the programming language 'M'. There are roughly 40 packages, or collections of programs specific to various services, such as Lab, Pharmacy, MAS, Surgery, Fiscal, and others. Each service has a computer coordinator, also known as a SAC, or Service Application Coordinator. You receive your access/verify codes from the SAC, as well as your menu options.     You MUST NOT share your access codes!! Someone else, using your menu, could enter erroneous data and endanger patient care. You can get whatever menu option you need from your Service Application Coordinator, See the Index for a phone list of the SAC's.  ;LOCAL> AND 'TIED' TERMINALS   There are two different ways to get into DHCP, depending on what appears on your screen when you press the <RET> key a few times.   If the text which appears ends with the words ACCESS CODE: you must type in your access code and press <RET>. (Your code will not appear on the screen.) When the screen prompts VERIFY CODE: enter your verify code, <RET> and the system will ask you to select from your main menu. It will also notify you of any new mail messages you may have.    You get 4 chances to enter your codes, after which the terminal will not allow further unsuccessful tries. It will reset in a few minutes.    If the prompt LOCAL> appears, this means you must call into the computer. Enter C DHCP and hit <RET> twice. The prompt for access and verify codewill appear, and you may sign in as usual. If you have been designated as a user in the test system, enter C TEST and press <RET> , then enter ""TEST"" at  the USERNAME: prompt You should then  get the access/verify code prompts. The test system is a 'dummy' system used for testing new software and for training, and does not contain real (live) patient information.  ;?,??,??? FOR MENU HELP   After you sign in , you are asked to ""select (your Primary menu) Option:"" If the entire menu has not already printed, enter '?' to see the options. You may also enter '0' (zero) at this point to see your secondary menu options, and pick one of them by number. There is some help text available for most options.   If you enter a single '?', you will get a list of options, and if you enter '??', you will get your menu options, their program names, and a listing of additional options which you can reach from any sub-menu .    Some of these options are MAIL, Time, Edit User Characteristics (so you can change your verify code and other personal data), the library menu, the Phone Directory, etc., and you can select your secondary menu items, if any have been assigned to you.   If you enter '???' you will get a brief description of what the option does.  ;THE '    The ' out of the system, or get options from other menus. You enter this symbol by holding the SHIFT key and pressing the number 6, then release both and <RET>. We call this the 'up-arrow'. Entering it in response to a request for input of data will take  you to the beginning of a new record in the file in which you're working, such as the patient file,the purchase order file, etc. In addition to using the up-arrow to 'back out' of a data input option, you can add it to an option name to jump into another menu option without the need for a lot of <RET>. For instance, if you are in the Lab Accessioning menu and want to get a result, enter  directly to the Results menu report option.   You can exit the system by pressing <RET> enough times until the system halts, or you can just enter 'HALT' at any menu prompt. You MUST halt from the system when you leave your terminal, or another person can use your menu and create security violations, alter patient data, send Mail messages under your name. REMEMBER TO LOG OUT when you leave the terminal!  ;THE '//' CONVENTION (DEFAULT ANSWERS)    When the computer prompts you to enter some data into  particular field, it may offer you an answer, followed by two slashes, as 'Read MAIL BASKET: IN//' or 'Select Patient Name: RINGO,JOHNNY//'.  The // means that what is in front of the two slashes will be entered by default when you <RET>, If the default is correct, just <RET> and you will move to the next field. If the default is incorrect, type in the correct answer and <RET>. The correct info will be stored for that field, and will appear as the default next time. REMEMBER-- if you see // after a data field entry, you enter the default by pressing <RET>.    When the information in a particular field is lengthy, as with a free- text field consisting of several lines of text, you may be invited to edit that information. The cue is the prompt 'EDIT Option:'. The next section is a primer in the use of the DHCP editor. ;THE EDIT OPTION    You may select either a line editor or a full screen editor. Do this by entering ""TB"" at any main menu prompt to get into your ToolBox, and answer the prompt ""PREFERRED EDITOR"" with the letter 'S' and you will then be able to use the screen editor, which is much more powerful than the line editor. Hit the F1 (or PF1) key and then hit 'H' for help with the screen editor. Type F1 and then 'E' to exit the screen editor.  ;EDITING, CONTINUED     The line editor is very literal--when you are replacing something, you must type the incorrect part exactly as it appears. There are shortcuts! You may have a paragraph with a number of instances where the date 1990 exists, and you want to change all the 1990's to 1992. At the EDIT Option: prompt you would enter a 'C' (for Change Every) and you could replace every incorrect number with a different number. This would be quicker and easier than using the 'Replace' function. Instead of typing in the entire phrase 'than a fish without a bicycle' you would enter 'than...cycle' to replace the entire phrase. You can even replace many lines at a time this way.  But if the system displays the text followed by'//', you will have to type all the new text. This will not happen if there are more than a couple words of text.    You can delete a line or a range of lines, move lines around (like the ""cut and paste"" editor), add lines to the end of the text, insert a line after a line number, and so forth. Use '???' at the 'EDIT Option:' prompt to see a listing of edit commands, or switch to the screen editor.  ;DATA FIELDS    When you enter data into the system, the data is placed into FIELDS, of which there are 7 types. They are: DATE/TIME, NUMERIC, SET OF CODES, FREE TEXT, WORD PROCESSING, COMPUTED, POINTER TO A FILE. Sometimes you need to know the rules for a particular field type. Entering '?' will usually give you enough information about the field to tell you what kind of data the system expects you to enter. Getting a 'beep' and two '??' means you are either entering the wrong kind of data, or something is missing.    DATE/TIME: You can enter the date in many ways, and a '?' will show you the acceptable ways. It is handy to enter a 'T' for today, 'T-1' or 'Y' for yesterday, or 'T+3W' for 3 weeks from today. 'N' will translate to 'NOW', and the system will fill in the date and time. You could also enter 'T+6M' for a date 6 moths hence.   FREE TEXT: Numbers, letters, puctuation are all acceptable--you can enter any characters on the keyboard, up to a certain number, usually from 3 to 30. Sometimes the data entered must match a certain pattern, such as SSN, or P.O. numbers in the IFCAP menu. If you enter something which does not match that pattern, you will hear a 'beep' from the keyboard, and get '??' from the screen. Enter '???' to see what the computer wants.  ;CORRECTING MISTAKES    You will sometimes make errors when typing in data. To correct them before you have hit a <RET>, you may 'back up' using the DELETE key, which is just above the <RET> key on VT320"

663401,ARLEM EVENT TYPE,,"ARLEM Event Type stores each of the events the Event Monitor responds to. The purpose of the Event Monitor is to capture clinically significantevents by inserting conditional protocols into the right protocol chainsconnected to clinical activities we're interested in. For each event, wefire via TCP/IP a copy of the HL7 message describing that event to anexternal Event Monitor running on a separate computer. To test the Event Monitor, we have created the Event Simulator, whichresponds to changes in this file. The event Simulator runs as a backgroundtask that monitors clinical events in the past and fires thecorresponding Event Monitor protocols as though the event had occurred inthe present. The Event Simulator uses the contents of this file to buildits list of events to monitor and to fire the corresponding events. Although at present only the Event Simulator directly uses this file, webelieve other parts of the Event Monitor may soon do so as well. Note that the contents of this file are used together with the ARLEMparameters in the Parameters file (# 8989.5) to guide the simulation. ARLEM Event Type was created by Rick Marshall at VA PSHCS on March 24,1999 in collaboration with Jim Savarino for Event Monitor version 0.1. Weconsidered using the Protocol file (# 101) instead of creating a new file,but decided file 101's purpose (as much as could be gleaned from thescanty Description) is orthogonal to ours, and many of the required fieldsof that file would seem to bear that out."

663600,MH PATIENT,,"CONTENTS: MH Patient stores a list of all patients seen by the MentalHealth service. This list is generated automatically when entries are madeto the Outpatient Encounter (409.68) or Patient Movement (405) fileslinking patients who are not in the MH Patient file to Ward Locations orStop Codes associated with Mental Health. NEW ENTRIES: Users should never need to manually add entries to this file,but may do so whenever they are sure a patient who has been treated by theMental Health service is nevertheless not in this file. The file wasoriginally populated to include all patients seen by Mental Health sinceOctober 1, 1998. FIELDS: The file itself is mainly a pointer file, DINUMed to the Patientfile (IENs match), with computed fields that return the value of commonlyneeded fields in the Patient file. SELECTING ENTRIES: Although the Record field (.01) will usually be used topick entries, it is a pointer and therefore does not make it easy to sortby name. SORTING ENTRIES: Use the Name field (.02) to sort by name instead of theRecord field (.01); this field has a copy of the Name field (.01) of thePatient file (2), and is set automatically when the Record field is firstset or changed to point to a new patient. If the Name field of the Patientfile entry later changes, someone must also manually change the Name fieldof this file to keep it the same. This design limitation can be fixed infuture versions of PSHCS Mental Health if it is too much of a problem. SECURITY: The Mental Health ADPACs need read, write, delete, and LAYGOaccess to this file. Key Mental Health users need read access. The IRMPackage Manager should continue to develop the file and add options asrequested by the ADPAC to help encapsulate the details of the file'sstructure. ** TECHNICAL INFORMATION ** ORIGINS: This file belongs to the Class III package PSHCS Mental Healthversion 1.0, developed by Rick Marshall at VA PSHCS August 2-4, 1999 incollaboration with Melissa Hughes. ORIGINAL ENTRIES: Its contents were populated by running the ARJTYSroutine, which scans the Patient Movement (405) and Outpatient Encounter(409.68) files for patients who have been to Ward Locations with theMental Health service or Stop Codes in the 500 series. See the routine'scomments for details. NEW ENTRIES: It will be kept populated by MUMPS cross-references (to benamed later) on files 405 and 409.68."

74,RAD/NUC MED REPORTS,,"This file contains the reports for registered exams.  These reports areusually first dictated by the interpreting physician before being enteredby the transcriptionist. The Radiology/Nuclear Medicine software includes an HL7 interface tosupport report entry using voice recognition systems. The data in this file has three basic sections:          I. Demographic information about the file                - patient, date reported, date entered etc.        II. Text Data                - clinical history, report and impression       III. Computed Fields that obtain data from patient's exam record                - technician, procedure etc. The computed fields can be a very efficent way to do File Man prints andsearches of exam record data, as opposed to doing prints and searchesthrough the 'RAD/NUC MED PATIENT' file.  Data Storage ------------The data for the 'RAD/NUC MED REPORTS file is stored in the global. This global is very volatile and should be journaled.It should also be translated if the operating system supports this function. Because of the large amount of disk space the report text will demand ofthe system, the module has a 'Purge Data' function that willallow the site manager to delete the 'REPORT TEXT' and 'CLINCIAL HISTORY'fields on a periodic basis. It is up to the computer site manager andthe imaging coordinator to determine how long this data will remainon-line. The 'IMPRESSION' text will not be purged. In the future, the module will also have an archive function.  Input Templates ---------------The following is a list of input templates used by the packageand the entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template:                    Compiled Name              Routine    Description; Option(s) ----              --------   ---------------------- RA REPORT EDIT                                  information into this file;                              RA RPTENTRY  RA VERIFY          REPORT ONLY                  RA BATCHVERIFY, RA RPTVERIFY  RA PRE-VERIFY REPORT EDIT    Used to edit reports and associated                               information in this file.

74.2,REPORT BATCHES,,"This file provides the mechanism to group draft reports into logicalcategories to help in the efficent processing of these reports. Usually, an interpreting physician dictates a series of reports onto onetape. The transcriptionist receives the tape and the patient foldersassociated with the reports dictated on the tape. By placing the reportsfor that tape in a single batch, usually by interpreting physician name,the following processes will be improved:          o re-printing the reports if the printer malfunctions.         o verifying the report can be done by batch with the           user only answering the 'report status' prompt for           each report. The system automatically proceeds through           the reports in the batch.         o if more than one transcriptionist has to print his/her reports           on the same printer then batch printing prevents           interweaving of each transcriptionist's reports. Naming of batches is controlled by the user and most often the name is thename of the interpreting physician whose dictation the user istranscribing. A user can only enter reports into a batch that he/shecreated.   Data Storage ------------The data for the 'REPORT BATCHES' file is stored in the global.

Although it is structurally and functionally an independent system, it is officially part of HL7 1.6.  This isa messaging system similar to the old HL7 1.6 package, but it was designed fromthe ground up and is more robust, more capable, and supports a much highermessage throughput.  This file contains the priorities of HLO queues as assigned by the systemoperations staff. It is not necessary to assign a priority to a queue.  However, doing sowill change the frequency that HLO services the queue.  Important queues thattend to be backed up should be assigned a higher priority.  Less importantqueues may be assigned a lower priority.  The goal of setting queue prioritiesis to balance the HLO resources over the queues in order to obtain a desiredperformance.Currently priorities may be set only for outgoing queues, though the filewas designed to also support the assignment of priorities for incomming queues.The option for entering the type of queue (incomming or outgoing) currentlywill automatically default to outgoing. A future enhancment may supportthe ability to assign priorities to incomming queues.To set the priority the name of the queue must be specified.  As explained, currently the queue will be assumed to be outgoing. Optionally,if the priorityis to be set only for a specific link then the link must be specified.Examples:You could set the priority of an outgoing queue named ""HLO OUT"" withoutspecifying the link.  The effect would be to set the priority of all outgoingqueues named ""HLO OUT"" regardless of the link.You could set the priority of an outgoing queue named ""HLO OUT"" and also specifythe link.  The effect would be to set the priority of the outgoingqueue named ""HLO OUT"" that is sending messages via that specific link only.If a queue's priority is specified to apply to all links, but that queue'spriority is also specified for a specific link, that specific priority settingwill override the general one.  "

While most medical centers only have one division, there are anumber that are multi-divisional.  As a result, it was necessary tostructure the entire system around the division concept. However, single division medical centers will not notice this in theeveryday execution of the module. Within a division there may be a number of physical locationswhere an imaging procedure can be performed.  The module is designed tohandle multiple locations within a division.  However, each location canonly be associated with one division.  Location data is stored in the'IMAGING LOCATIONS' file (#79.1). These parameters are loaded into the user's partition once the moduledetermines which division and location the user is currently associatedwith.  This is determined by one of two ways: 1) the device the user isusing is an entry in the 'INPUT DEVICES' sub-file of the 'IMAGINGLOCATIONS' file or 2) if (1) is not true than the module will simply askthe user what his/her current location is.

798.2,ROR SELECTION RULE,,"The ROR SELECTION RULES file contains definitionsof the selection rules that are used to screenpatients for addition to the registries. There aretwo kinds of rules: top-level and lower level. If a rule is referenced by the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file, it is the top-level rule.Non-zero value of any top-level rule expression directly determines that the patient should beadded to the corresponding registry. Lower level rules are referenced only by other rules (by rule macros in the expressions). Theirexpressions are evaluated in the proper order, andthe result values are used in the expressions of other rules. Lower level rules have an indirectimpact on the final result and can be used forcomplex processing of linked files and multiples. For example, a lower level rule can calculate maximum and minimum values of a parameter in thesub-file, and a top-level rule will analyze thesevalues and decide if the patient should be added to the registry. Moreover, they could be used tosplit a very complex rule into several simplerrules. Records of the file are uniquely identified by therule name (the ""A"" primary key and the uniquenessindex ""B"" are used for this purpose)."

801.41,REMINDER DIALOG,,"This file is used to define all of the components that work together to define a reminder dialog. Reminder dialog definitions are used by the CPRS GUI for reminder resolution.   This file contains a combination of nationally distributed entries, local auto-generated entries, site and VISN exchanged entries and local manually created entries. Nationally distributed dialog, element, and group entries have their name prefixed with VA-. Nationally distributed Prompts, Forced Value, Result Groups, and Result Elements have their name prefixed with PXRM. Entries in this file may be auto-generated via the Dialog Management Menu option. Manually created dialog entries should use local namespacing conventions. Nationally distributed entries will have their class type defined as National. Entries created at the VISN level should be defined as VISN and entries created at a site should be defined as Local.   This file is similar to the option file where there are different types of entries (reminder dialog, dialog elements (sentences), prompts, and groups of elements, result elements and groups of result elements). Where an option has menu items, the dialog file has components that are entered, with the sequence field as the .01 field.  A prompt is defined for PCE prompts, WH Notification Purpose, or as locally created comment check-boxes. The prompts will not have any components within them. PXRM-prefixed prompts are distributed in this file with the Clinical Reminder package.   A dialog element is defined primarily to represent sentences to display in the CPRS window with a check-box. When the user checks the sentence off, theFINDING ITEM in the dialog element and the ADDITIONAL FINDINGS will be added to the list of PCE updates, orders, WH Notification Purposes, and mental health tests. The updates won't occur on the CPRS GUI until the user clicks on the FINISH button. Dialog elements may have components added to them. Auto-generated components will be based on the additional prompts defined in the Finding Type Parameters. Once a dialog element is auto-generated, the sites can modify them.   Dialog elements may also be instructional text or a header. The FINDING ITEM and components would not be defined in dialog elements.   A dialog group is similar to menu options. It groups dialog elements and dialog groups within its component multiple. The dialog group can be defined with a finding item and a check-box. The components in the group can be hidden from the CPRS GUI window until the dialog group is checked off.  A result element contains special logic that uses information entered during the resolution process to create a sentence to add to the progress note. The special logic contains a CONDITION that, when true, will use the ALTERNATE PROGRESS NOTE TEXT field to update the progress note. A separate result element is used for each separate sentence needed. The result element is only used with mental health test finding items. Default result elements are distributed for common mental health tests, prefixed with PXRM and the mental health test name. Sites may copy them and modify their local versions as needed.   A result group contains all of the result elements that need to be checked to create sentences for one mental health test finding. The dialog element for the test will have its RESULT GROUP/ELEMENT field defined with the result group. Default result groups for mental health tests are distributed with the Clinical Reminders package. Sites may copy them and modify their local versions as needed.  Sites should name locally created items according to their local naming convention."

For example, Education topicsentered for a current visit are ""DONE AT ENCOUNTER"", Education topicsentered for a historical visit are ""DONE ELSEWHERE"", Education topics witha Level of Understanding of Refused are ""PATIENT REFUSED"" resolutions. Thehealth factor is a file of findings that we cannot categorize without thesites telling us what the related resolution status should be. The statuses will be used in the future for roll-up counts to reflect howreminders were resolved (done, historical, refused, contraindicated,ordered)."

810.2,REMINDER EXTRACT DEFINITION,,"National extract definitions were sent out with Clinical Reminders V.2.0 tosupport site roll-up of reporting totals to the Austin Automation Center(AAC).  The generic extract functionality supports corporate level managementanalysis by providing reports that:  - summarize patient reminder compliance totals (not applicable,   applicable, due, not due) - summarize finding total counts that reflect the most recent findings   resulting from reminder evaluation - summarize finding total counts that reflect site activities during the   reporting month.   - list unique applicable patients included in the finding count (Patient   List is not sent to Austin) An extract definition may be manually run or set-up to automatically runmonthly or quarterly.  The extract can be defined to only produce compliancetotals, or to also include finding totals. Each extract definition identifies: -  Which type of totals the extract will create: compliance, finding  -  What patient list(s) should be created first, second, third, , and    what criteria should be used to build the patient list(s). -  For each patient list created when the extract is run, what reminders    should be run. -  For each reminder run, what findings found should be used to include    in finding count totals, based on the reminder status for each    patient, and pre-defined counting groups. -  Counting groups are used to define findings that may have been found    from reminder evaluation, as well as findings that may not be in the    reminder but need to be counted for utilization counts. -  Counts are accumulated depending on whether the reminder status was    applicable, not applicable, due or not due for the patient. -  Utilization counts count how many times the findings in a counting    group were entered during the reporting period for the patients in    the patient list. The extract definition also identifies the last extract reporting period runand the next reporting period to be run.  This information is used to supportmanaging extract runs.  The next reporting period is used by the nextautomated run to know which period should be run.   The reporting results are stored in the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file (#811.3) The national extract definitions are defined in this file to support genericextract and roll-up needs by facility. The generic extract tools provideoptions to: -  manage extract criteria  -  manage extract runs (manual and automated) -  manage transmissions to AAC -  view extract reporting results -  view the list of patients making up the patient denominator When analyzing the results of an extract run, it is important to take note ofthe following information before drawing conclusions: - list rule criteria used to create the target patient lists   (denominators) - reminder definition used to create applicable, not applicable, due and   not due compliance and finding totals - counting rules used to accumulate totals  - counting groups of findings and the type of totals accumulated (all   patients, applicable, due or not due patients) The following is a comparison of Reminder Due and Reminder Extract reportfunctionality:   Reminder Due reports:    Use report criteria and pre-defined report templates with location/clinic   stop, provider, and team lists to build the list of patients that will be    used to evaluate reminders.      National Reminder Due report criteria and pre-defined report templates are    not nationally distributed.    The Reminder Due report evaluates reminders and provides counts for Total   patients, applicable patients and patients due.    The patient with a Due status can be saved in a Reminder Patient List for   further follow-up Patient Demographic and Health Summary reporting.    The findings in the reminder are not used to accumulate counts.    An existing Reminder Patient List can be used to identify target patients,   instead of report criteria and report templates.    The Reminder Due report can be created in a Summary or detailed report   format, and is typically queued to run in a job during off-hours.  National extract reports:    Defines complex extract criteria into one extract definition that is   pre-defined as a national Reminder Extract Definition.    Pre-defined national extract criteria uses findings (reminder terms),   independent of a reminder definition, to build one or more lists of   patients that are used to evaluate one or more reminders.    National extract criteria used to identify patients is similar to VA   External Peer Review (EPRP) performance measure reporting criteria.     EPRP performance measures often require a current qualifying visit and   an anchor visit during the previous year. Since some patients seen   during a reporting month do not have a prior year anchor visit, the   national extract's total patient counts for a given month will   typically be less than the Reminder Due report's total patient counts   for the same month.    The lists of patients used for each reporting period's national   extract are stored on the local system for sites to validate the   patient denominator counts and provide local quality of care   monitoring.    Compliance total counts are accumulated based on the reminder status   for each patient: total, applicable, not applicable, due, and not   due.  The extract criteria used to create the totals is stored with    the total counts on the local system, as well as transmitted to the   AAC.    Finding total counts are accumulated for pre-defined national finding groups   based on the findings found during reminder evaluation for the patient. The   finding counts are totaled into categories that reflect the reminder status   for each patient: total, applicable, not applicable, due and not due patient   counts.  The finding counts are sent to the AAC with the extract criteria    used to create the counts.    Utilization counts are accumulated for pre-defined national finding groups   that count how many times specified findings were entered during the    reporting period for patients for each patient denominator.  The finding    counts are sent to the AAC with the extract criteria used to create the    counts.    Each patient that had a finding count is stored on the local system for   follow-up patient care and validation of reporting results. The patients are   not sent to the AAC.    The national extract tools use Mailman links with the HL7 interface to send   compliance totals and finding totals for each monthly period to the AAC. AAC   adds the national monthly reporting to the Compliance Totals National    Database stored at the AAC.    The national extract reports are generated by a job. IRM Staff can help set   up each type of extract definition to automatically reschedule itself to run   monthly at each site. The extract run needs to occur prior to the tenth of   each month.     The sites can manually rerun an extract and/or selectively retransmit an   extract to AAC in the event of a failed transmission. The Extract Summary   reports may be used to verify compliance totals.      Parties interested in viewing the AAC Compliance Totals National Database   may be granted read-only access to this data.  The AAC uses the   national database to create Simple Authentication and Security (SAS)   files with read-only access. File relationships:    The extract definition uses list rules (#810.4) to build lists of patients.   If the extract definition is for Compliance and Finding Totals, the extract   definition will be defined with counting rules (#810.7). The counting rules   will be defined based on counting groups (#810.8).     Data from the extract is stored in the extract summary file (#810.3) and    patient lists are saved in the patient list file (#810.5).

810.3,REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY,,"This file stores compliance totals found for a specific extract.  The extract Entries are read only and may be selected by number or extract name. The extract Summary entries are currently created from two types ofprocessing:1) Generic EXTRACT tool manual runs and automated runs2) LREPI ENHANCE MANUAL RUN and LREPI NIGHTLY TASK on day 15 of each monthGeneric extract summary entries:The REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY NAME is the combination of a unique abbreviation.When the extract is created from the EXTRACT manual and automated options, theREMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY NAME will include Q, M, or Y (for quarterly, monthly,or yearly), nn for month or quarter, and yyyy for year. The following is anexample of extract names:     VA-IHD QUERI 2006 M2          VA-IHD QUERI 2006 M1         VA-IHD QUERI 2005 M12     National extract summary entries created from generic Reminder Extractfunctionality (not LREPI) are stored with a VA- prefixed name.  Each extractentry contains reminder compliance totals for each unique combination ofpatient list and reminder.  The extract will optionally store findingcompliance totals if the TYPE OF TOTALS for the extract is ""Compliance andFinding Totals"". No patient specific data is stored in the extract summaryfile for generic extracts.  The patient lists (denominators) used to createthe extract summary totals, for a particular reporting period, are availablefrom Reminder Patient List options.  Generic extract summary entries will default to be purged after 5 years.  Theautomated purge status can be changed for a particular extract summary entryto retain the entry indefinitely.  LREPI extract summary entries:The LREPI extract names use YY/MM representing the ending year andmonth of the extract date range, and the run date in the format YYMMDD. Thedate and time of the run is an identifier.  The following is an example ofLREPI extract names.    LREPI 00/05 061500         LREPI 00/06 073100         LREPI 00/07 081500   The LREPI extract entries assume all results are for the primary institution,and includes patient specific data with findings.  The LREPI extracts createdare based on LREPI reporting criteria which is not available for genericreporting functionality.    This file will maintain up to 36 extract entriesfor each type of extract.  After 36 entries, when a new entry is added, theoldest entry is deleted from the file.  Sites are asked to run the LREPIENHANCE MANUAL RUN for months starting from 10/01/98 through 8/31/00. This willseed the Emerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) database with risk assessmentdata.  Subsequent updates to the EPI database will automatically occur monthlyvia the LREPI NIGHTLY TASK option. Sites will have up to 36 months of extracts.This may be fewer than 36 months if the site runs extracts for the same monthmore than once.  Multiple extracts for the same month occur when the site runsthe LREPI ENHANCE MANUAL RUN for a month to fix errors found by the receivingnational database.  For LREPI runs, the receiving national database is theEmerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) at the Austin  Automation Center (AAC).   An LREPI entry in the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file contains information that identifies the extract entry, the extract findings, and totals by finding item. The extract entry information includes the number, extract name, beginning andending extract dates, person who ran the extract option, task number, totalpatients evaluated and total patients with findings.  The extract findingsinclude a number (for ease of selecting a finding item), patient, reminderterm, value, alternate id, finding date, related visit (if PCE data), encountertype (I/O), result, value, drug and DSUP (days supply).  These extract findingfields are returned by the reminder evaluation logic.  The result, value, anddrug are all free text fields without specific input and output transformsbecause the data comes from the source VistA data it came from, with read onlyaccess on this file.  The alternate id is specific to the LREPI extracts.  Anumber value in the alternate id field indicates that the finding is forHepatitis C risk assessment.  The alternate id will be used for statisticalpurposes in the EPI database.      The flow of LREPI processing is as follows: 1) LREPI gathers Lab Search/Extractpatients and findings 2) LREPI gets all patients and findings from a reminderextract evaluation process given the extract date range and reminder list. (The reminder list is from a new LREPI file 69.51).  2.1) The reminder extractevaluation logic uses medications mapped to reminder terms in the VA-NATIONALEPI RX EXTRACT reminder, and the extract date range, to call new inpatientpharmacy and outpatient pharmacy extract logic to get patient pharmacyfindings.  2.2) The reminder extract evaluation uses the remaining remindercriteria to build a list of patients with findings from the following files inthe extract period:   LAB DATA           (#63)   V POV              (#9000010.07)   V HEALTH FACTORS   (#9000010.23)   V PATIENT ED       (#9000010.16)   V EXAM             (#9000010.13) 2.3) The list of patients is used to evaluate the VA-HEP C RISK ASSESSMENT andVA-NATIONAL EPI LAB EXTRACT reminders.  The findings within the extract daterange are added as Extract Findings in the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file andthen returned to the Lab Search/Extract process.  3) The Lab Search/Extractprocess uses the final list of patients and findings to create HL7 messages. Each reminder finding for a patient is used to create a DSP segment.  Pharmacyfindings contain both a DSP and ZXE segment.  4) When the AAC processes themessages, error messages are returned for each message with the SSN related tothe erroneous data. Note: Messages with errors are not added to the EPIdatabase.  When erroneous data is  fixed at the site, the LREPI ENHANCE MANUALRUN is run for the month with the error to transmit the entire month's dataagain.  The new data for each patient and finding date  replaces the oldpatient and finding date's data.  5) Two new options are available on theREMINDER REPORTS menu that provide total counts by finding item, as well as adetailed list by finding item and SSN.  6) Sites are encouraged to provideFileMan read-only access to the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file (810.3) for thosewho validate the extract data, the Hepatitis C implementation team, andHepatitis C Coordinators responsible for monitoring Hepatitis C activities ateach site.  "

810.4,REMINDER LIST RULE,,"This file is used to define what extract criteria should be used to buildreminder patient lists. Extract criteria is defined as ""list rules"" in thisfile. The file is used by the Reminder Patient List option and ReminderExtract Management option to create patient lists.  There are four types of rule criteria in the List Rule file:    Patient List - defines an existing patient list   Finding Rule  - defines reminder terms that specify findings                   and the date ranges to use  Reminder Rule - defines a reminder definition that builds a patient list                  based on the patient cohort logic using the ending date as                  the evaluation date.   Rule Set      - defines a multiple of sequentially defined list rules                   (a rule set can not be included in the multiple). The rule criteria are combined into a Rule Set that defines how to use thecriteria to create or modify a patient list. Rule Sets allow lists of patientsto be manipulated when a patient meets specified criteria by the followingoperations:    ADD     to a new or existing patient list   REMOVE   from an existing list   SELECT   retain a patient in an existing list if the patient meets the            criteria, and remove the patient if the patient does not meet            the criteria.   A rule set can contain multiple operations. One operation can be defined foreach sequence in the rule set.   Nationally distributed list rules are prefixed with 'VA-' and cannot bemodified by sites.  FINDING RULES and Date Ranges:------------------------------------------------------------A Date Range is used by FINDING RULES to search for findings.List build processing determines which Beginning Date/time and Ending Date/timeto use when evaluating each finding based on where the date/times are defined.Beginning Date/Time (BDT) and Ending Date/Time (EDT) fields can be defined atmultiple levels:1  List Build action BDT and EDT: default when not defined at lower level  2  Rule Set Sequence BDT and EDT: overrides previous level    3  List Rule BDT and EDT: overrides previous levels      4  Term Finding BDT and EDT: overrides previous levelsThis override relationship can be defined with the following equation, where""<"" should be interpreted as ""is overridden by"":List Build < rule set sequence < list rule < term's findingList Build and date range evaluation:------------------------------------The List Build BDT and EDT are specified by the user selecting the List Buildaction. The List Build BDT and EDT is the default date range when the BDT andEDT are not defined for the rule set sequence, list rule, or term finding. Thedefault date range is used to find a match on each finding in the criteria. If no date range limits should be used to find a match on finding, either therule set sequence or list rule needs to be defined with a zero in the BDT orEDT fields, or both. A zero in the BDT field means start with the patient'soldest data. A zero in the EDT field represents the end of the day on the daythe list is built. Note: This is in contrast to Reminder Definitions, where theBDT and EDT for a finding are left blank to specify no limits. In the REMINDERLIST RULE file, if zero is defined in the BDT, and the EDT is left blank, thelist build tools will assume both BDT and EDT should not have date rangelimits, and vice versa if EDT has the 0 and the BDT is blank. The use of ""T"" in the BDT or EDT fields always represents the List Build endingdate/time specified for the list build action or the extract reporting period,depending on whether a reminder patient list or extract option is being used tobuild the list.""BDT"" may also be used in the BDT or EDT fields and represents the startingdate/time specified for the list build process or the extract reporting period.BDT-5Y creates a date five years prior to the beginning date/time. If the ending date/time is earlier than the beginning date/time, then nofinding matches will be found.REMINDER RULES and Date Ranges:------------------------------------------------------------Reminder Rules do not use the Beginning Date/time from the List Build, ListRule Sequence or Reminder Rule Beginning Date/time fields. Reminder evaluationusing date ranges is based on existing reminder definitions. However, aReminder Rule will use the Ending Date/time (EDT) from the Reminder Rule, ListRule Sequence, or List Build EDT. The same EDT overrides that are used forFinding Rule EDT are also used for Reminder Rule. The EDT used for reminderevaluation can be defined at multiple levels:1  List Build action EDT: default when not defined at lower level  2  Rule Set Sequence EDT: overrides previous level    3  List Rule EDT: overrides previous levels      4  Reminder evaluation is not impacted by terms in the reminder         definition."

810.7,REMINDER EXTRACT COUNTING RULE,,"This file is used during extract processing when an extract definition's TYPEOF TOTALS field is defined with COMPLIANCE AND FINDING TOTALS. When theextract type is for COMPLIANCE TOTALS only, there will not be an extractcounting rule defined in the REMINDER EXTRACT DEFINITION file (#810.2). Whenthe extract type includes FINDING TOTALS, then the extract definition needs toreference a counting rule for each reminder processed by the extract. In the Extract definition, there is a basic hierarchy as followsExtract general information   Patient List to build and list rules to build them      Reminders to be run with the Patient List         Extract Counting Rules that define how to count findings An entry in the REMINDER EXTRACT COUNTING RULE file identifies how groups offindings should be accumulated based on the reminder status.Each group of findings is defined as a counting group in the REMINDER EXTRACTCOUNTING GROUP file (#810.8).One counting group can be referenced multiple times in a particular countingrule to collect counts in multiple ways. The unique combination of a countinggroup and a Reminder Status field is what makes the counts different. TheReminder Status field is the status associated with the patient when thereminder was evaluated. Each patient is always in the TOTAL PATIENTS count,but the patient is included in the APPLICABLE PATIENTS, DUE PATIENTS, or NOTDUE PATIENTS counts depending on the reminder status for each patient. For example: A counting group defined with possible LDL value ranges, can bedefined to get multiple counts, depending on the patient's REMINDER STATUS.When TOTAL PATIENTS Reminder Status is defined with the counting group: Everypatient in the patient list is used to find a match on the findings in thegroup. If a finding match is found, a count is accumulated into columns basedon the reminder status of APPLICABLE, NOT APPLICABLE, DUE or NOT DUE. When APPLICABLE PATIENTS Reminder Status is defined with the counting group:Patients from the patient list, where the reminder was applicable, are used tofind a match on the findings in the group. If a finding match is found, a countis accumulated into columns for each finding in the group based on the reminderstatus of APPLICABLE, NOT APPLICABLE, DUE or NOT DUE. Applicable patientsshould have 0 counts in the NOT APPLICABLE count for each finding. When DUE PATIENTS Reminder Status is defined with the counting group: Patientsfrom the patient list, where the reminder was due are used to find a match onthe findings in the group. If a finding match is found, a count is accumulatedinto columns for each finding in the group based on the reminder status ofAPPLICABLE, NOT APPLICABLE, DUE or NOT DUE. Due patients should have 0 countsin the NOT APPLICABLE and NOT DUE count for each finding.When NOT DUE PATIENTS Reminder Status is defined with the counting group:Patients from the patient list, where the reminder was not due are used to finda match on the findings in the group. If a finding match is found, a count isaccumulated into columns for each finding in the group based on the reminderstatus of APPLICABLE, NOT APPLICABLE, DUE or NOT DUE. Due patients should have0 counts in the NOT APPLICABLE and DUE count for each finding.The accumulated counts for each finding are stored in the REMINDER EXTRACTSUMMARY file (#810.3). The sequence number in the file determines the orderthe counts will be accumulated for, saved to, and displayed from the REMINDEREXTRACT SUMMARY file (#810.3). The counts can be used to make comparisons between TOTAL PATIENTS, APPLICABLEPATIENTS, DUE PATIENTS, and NOT DUE PATIENTS counts.         If no counting groups are defined in the extract counting rule, then no findingtotals will be accumulated. Nationally distributed extract counting rules are prefixed 'VA-' and cannot bemodified by sites. Sites should name locally created extract counting rules according to their local naming convention. "

Terms created for VISN use will have aCLASS of ""VISN""Before a term can be used, it must have findings mapped to it. Thefindings that can be mapped to a term are any of the standardClinical Reminder findings with the exception of terms.Reminder terms are useful for national reminders involving findingsthat are based on local file definitions (e.g., laboratory test, drugfile, radiology). National reminder terms have limited editingcapabilities, which allow sites to map their local finding items to aterm.

8925.1,TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION,,"This file stores Document Definitions, which identify and define behaviorfor documents stored in the TIU DOCUMENTS FILE (#8925).  For consistencywith the V-file schema, it may be viewed as the ""Attribute Dictionary"" forthe Text Integration Utilities. It also stores Objects, which can be embedded in a Document Definition'sBoilerplate Text (Overprint). Objects contain M code which gets a piece ofdata and inserts it in the document's Boilerplate Text when a document isentered. Warning: objects embedded in boilerplate text are looked up by multipleindex (i.e. DIC(0) contains 'M'). Current code (see routine CHECKchecks all present indexes to make sure object names, abbreviations andprint names are not ambiguous for this lookup. If new indexes are added,this code MUST BE UPDATED to check the new index as well. Some entries in this file are developed Nationally and exported across thecountry.  Others are created by local sites.  Entries in the firstcategory are marked National Standard and are not editable by sites. This file does NOT allow multiple entries OF THE SAME TYPE with the samename.  That is, within a given Type, there are no duplicate names. (Thisrefers to the .01 field, the Technical name of the entry.) This file does not allow a parent to have items with the same name, evenif the items have different internal file numbers (i.e. are different fileentries).  Again, this refers to the .01 Technical name of the entry. Because of ownership considerations, the file does NOT allow an entry tobe an item under more than 1 parent.  If the same item is desired undermore than 1 parent, the item must be copied into a new entry.  There isone exception:  Document Definitions of Type Component which have beenmarked Shared may have more than one parent. The Document Definition Utility TIUF categorizes certain fields as Basic,Technical, or Upload, and displays these fields together as a group whenuser edits or views a Document Definition. BASIC fields include Name,Abbreviation, Print Name, Type, Personal Owner, Class Owner, Status, InUse, Shared, Orphan, Has Boiltxt, National Standard, OK to Distribute, andSuppress Visit Selection. TECHNICAL fields include Entry Action, ExitAction, Edit Template, Print Method, Print Form Header, Print Form Number,Print Group, Allow Custom Form Headers, Visit Linkage Method, ValidationMethod, and Object Method. UPLOAD fields include Upload Target File, LaygoAllowed, Target Text Field Subscript, Upload Look-up Method, UploadPost-Filing Code, Upload Filing Error Code, and multiples Upload CaptionedASCII Header and Upload Delimited ASCII Header. The Document Definition file contains extensive, detailed fielddescriptions. Likewise, some protocols (File 101) used in TIU haveextensive and careful descriptions in the Protocol file. Many of thesedescriptions are used in TIU for online help. If it becomes necessary fora national programmer to edit these descriptions, the programmer shouldcheck to make sure all online help is still displayed properly. Users are expected to use the Document Definition Utility TIUF to enter,edit, and delete file entries.  In fact, the file prohibits the deletionof entries through generic Fileman Options.  It also prohibits the editthrough generic Fileman of a few critical fields: Type, Status, Shared,and National Standard.  Adding and Deleting (but not editing) Items isalso prohibited through generic Fileman options.  Abbreviation and PrintName of OBJECTS cannot be edited through generic Fileman Options. This does NOT imply that it is SAFE to use generic Fileman to edit otherfields.  Users are cautioned that edit through generic Fileman bypassesmany safeguards built in to the Document Definition Utility and can createhavoc unless the user THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS the File and its uses. If users find needs which are not met through TIUF, please communicatethem to the TIU development team.                                                          ***************** WARNING: Using generic Fileman options to edit entries can cause SERIOUSdatabase problems.                                ****************"

Documents mayalso need to be reprinted AFTER completion for certain events such asamendment. Any event which should trigger auto printing of the document should beentered as an auto print event. - SIGNED means firstline signature, as opposed to secondline cosignature.- COSIGNED, OPTIONAL, INCOMPLETE means when an incomplete document obtainsan optional cosignature.- COSIGNED, OPTIONAL, COMPLETED means when a previously completeddocument obtains an optional cosignature, namely, a walkup.- COMPLETED means when some event occurs that completes the document, forexample the document obtains its last expected optional cosignature. If one event occurs to a document and corresponds to two selected printevents (such as COMPLETED and COSIGNED OPTIONAL INCOMPLETE), the documentwill only print once. If parameter is not entered and Document Definition has no ancestor toinherit from, parameter assumes default value N for NONE.  If parameter isnot entered and Document Definition has a parent to inherit from, thenparameter assumes value (assumed or explicit) of parent print events.

8930,USR CLASS,,"This file is intended to allow the definition of user classes in such away that they are useful across packages.  It will undoubtedly evolve withmore experience in this area. These user classes are then used to support part of the the""authorization"" concept - who may do what to a document, order, etc. They are also used to support part of the ""subscription"" concept - whoshould receive something, e.g. a notification that a document needssignature. The User Authorization/Subscription file points to the User Class file toallocate authorizations/subscriptions to appropriate user classes. The User Class Membership file links users in the New Person file to UserClasses. This file supports an infinite hierarchy of subclasses, with each entryhaving as many subclasses as desired.  Subclasses are contained in thesame file, as entries in their own right.  A class automatically containsas members all members of its subclasses, as well as explicit members ofthe class itself."
8930.01,SUBCLASS,8930,"If for example Service Chief is entered as a subclass of Staff Physician,then persons listed as service chiefs inherit all privileges assigned tostaff physicians.A subclass of a class is a subset of the class.  For example, sincethe class Staff Physician. Subclasses will be used for inheriting user authorizations/subscriptions.For example, if an entry in the User Authorization/Subscription file statesthat the user class Staff Physician may sign progress notes, and if theentry states that this entry includes user subclasses, and if Servicechief is a subclass of class Staff Physician in the User Class file,then service chiefs may also sign progress notes. If a User Authorization/Subscription file entry includes user subclasses,it also includes subclasses of subclasses, etc."
8930.1,USR AUTHORIZATION/SUBSCRIPTION,,"This file associates users with actions on documents. Actions are of 2 kinds: authorization actions such as the signature action,which an associated user is authorized to perform, and subscriptionactions, such as an unsigned document notification, which the associateduser ""signs up to receive."" An action may be associated with a USER CLASS in the User Class file(e.g. Staff Physician class) AND/OR with a USER ROLE in relation to thedocument (e.g. author of document). If an Authorization/Subscription entry has both User Class AND User Role,the AND FLAG field permits these requirements to be ""AND'ed"", that is, auser must both belong to the User Class AND must fill the User Role inorder to perform the action.  If the AND FLAG has value OR, or has novalue, then User Class and User Role within the same entry are ""OR'ed"". Each file entry associates an action with 1 user class and/or 1 role.  Theentry makes this association for a given Document Definition (e.g.Progress Note) of a given status (e.g. Unsigned). Multiple file entries for the SAME action/Document Definition/documentstatus allow association with more than one user class/role.  Such entriesare ""OR'ed"":  that is, if a user belongs to the user class/role of one ORanother of these entries, the user may perform the action. User classes automatically INCLUDE user subclasses of the given class asdefined in the User Class file. Document Definitions exist in hierarchy in file 8925.1, with Classes atthe top level, Document Classes at the next level down, and Titles underDocument Classes.  Authorization/Subscription entries may be defined atany of the above levels.  For example, an authorization which applies tomost or all Progress Notes should be defined at the Class level forDocument Definition ""Progress Note.""  On the other hand, an authorizationwhich applies only to Progress Notes of Title ""Dental Hygiene Note"" shouldbe defined at the Title level for Document Definition ""Dental HygieneNote"". When using authorizations/subscriptions to determine whether a givenuser should receive/may perform a given action for a Document Definitionof a given Title, code begins by checking entries for that action andstatus FOR THAT TITLE.  If ANY such entries exist, then entries for higherDocument Definition levels will be ignored, and the user passes/failsbased on that level alone.  Thus, if a Title is linked with a certainaction, status and user class, then rules for that Title, action, andstatus should be entered for ALL user classes which can perform theaction on the Title, since broader authorization (e.g. Provider class)set at higher levels (e.g. Progress Notes) is ignored. If such entries do NOT exist, the next higher level of Document Definitionis checked.  And so on. If no entries are found on any level, no users can perform/subscribe tothe action for the given Document Definition and status."
8930.11,DESCRIPTION,8930.1," For most entries, the meaning of the entry will be clear from thedescription of the associated event in the TIU Event file.  In some cases,that may not suffice, in which case this field may be used to further For example, if an entry associates the Signature event with a document ofstatus completed, it might help to note in the description field that sucha signature is a walkup signature. It should not be necessary to describe consequences in this field - thosedescriptions may be gotten from the associated protocol descriptionsinstead. This field will be used when persons associating users with user classeswish to know the meaning of events associated with certain user classes."

Since user class membership includes members of allsubclasses, users should be made members of the most discrete class in ahierarchy of classes.  For example, if Jones is a dentist, Jones should beentered into the Dentist class.  Since Dentist is a subclass of theProvider class, Jones is then automatically a Provider. Persons wearing several different hats can have more than one entry in thefile.  For example, Smith might be a dietician also working toward anursing degree.  Smith could be entered twice, once as a Dietician andonce as a Student Nurse."

Forexample, a user is authorized to perform the Signature action, but a usersubscribes to (""signs up to receive"") a Notification action."
8930.81,IMPLIED EVENT,8930.8,"Some events imply other events.  For example, the ability to Sign adocument implies the ability to View the document.  Thus, View is animplied event for the Signature event. Authorization/Subscription file, the user will be shown implied events forthe given event and asked if they wish to include implied events for thecurrent entry.  If so, a copy of the current entry will be created for eachimplied event."
8930.82,DESCRIPTION,8930.8," The event description will be used in conjunction with theAuthorization/Subscription field to define what it means to associateusers with the event.In most cases, this event description will suffice to determine themeaning of User Authorization/Subscription file entries. In rare cases, further description of what an event means when associatedwith users, document type and document status will be made in thedescription field of the User Authorization/Subscription file.  Forexample, a signature event associated with documents of statuscompleted means a walkup signature. This information will be used by persons creating entries in the UserAuthorization/Subscription file and by persons assigning users to userclasses, when checking what events those user classes are associated with."

By using the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)Broker, applications running on client workstations can invoke (call) theprocedures in this file to be executed by the server and the results will bereturned to the client application.Each remote procedure entry is associated with an entry point (ROUTINE withoptional TAG).  Calls to these procedures can include parameters of differentvalue types.  The resulting value of the call can be either a string, a listof strings or a word processing string as indicated by the RETURN VALUE TYPEfield (.04).The remote procedure may be available for use by anyone or its use may berestricted to one or more application.  The range of availability is indicatedby the AVAILABILITY field.  IF THERE IS NO ENTRY IN THE AVAILABILITY FIELD,then the procedure is assumed to be PUBLIC.A remote procedure may be removed from service for a period of time by settingthe INACTIVE field.  A request for use of a procedure which is marked inactivewill result in an error being returned to the originating application."

8994.171,PORT,8994.17,"This is the TCP/IP port that the listener should monitor for incomingconnection requests.  This is the port which a client should use toconnect to a server. Don't use a port that is already in use on the CPU where you want to runthe listener.  No two processes can share the same TCP/IP port on thesame CPU. Typically, port numbers bellow 5000 are reserved for various common TCP/IPservices.  So you should use port numbers 9000 and above."
8994.5,REMOTE APPLICATION,,"The REMOTE APPLICATION file was introduced as part of the Broker Security Enhancement to secure access via the remote user or visitor approach by GUI applications (formerly known as the CAPRI approach for the first application to use this access style).  The remote visitor access permits applications where users need to access a large number of sites to do so without requiring a separate access code and verify code at each site. Following the Broker Security Enhancement, applications will be able to use the remote visitor access only if they have an entry in this file witha one-way hash of a secure phrase.  Identification of an entry in the fileis based on the application passing in the original phrase which is thenhashed and used for a cross-reference lookup. The application must have atleast one entry in the CALLBACKTYPE sub-file indicating a connection type,a valid address for the authenticating server, and a connection portnumber.  This information is necessary for the remote server to directlyconnect the authenticating server to obtain the demographic informationnecessary to create or match the visitor entry in the NEW PERSON file(#200).  The application will also specify the desired context option forthe user and this will be given to the remote visitor instead of theapplication having to figure out how to set this value."
8994.51,CALLBACKTYPE,8994.5,"This is a multiple field.  It may contain multiple values describing mechanisms by which the remote site can contact the application's authenticating site to obtain the demographic information.  It consists of the following subfields:    .01 CALLBACKTYPE   .02 CALLBACKPORT   .03 CALLBACKSERVER   .04 URLSTRING"

This same requirement does not exist in the VA. Data must exist in both the Patient/IHS file and the Visit file beforedata can be entered here.  There can be multiple providers for a givenvisit.

POV is an abbreviation for ""Purpose ofVisit"" (descriptive name used by IHS) or ""Problem of Visit"" (descriptivename used by VA). The V POV file is used to store clinical data related to the ""purpose ofvisit"" or ""problem of visit"", (POV). This is the provider's definition ofwhat diagnosis to use to represent the patient care given at the visit.The POV entry is not the patient's ""Chief Complaint"" text.  It is thediagnosis as defined by the provider which will have an ICD Diagnosiscode related to it to support Clinical needs and additionally supportAdministrative functions too such as Billing, Workload, and DSS.   There should be at least one ""purpose of visit"" (descriptive name used byIHS) or one ""problem of visit"" (descriptive name used by the VA) in the VPOV file for each patient visit whether it is an inpatient, outpatient orfield visit, and regardless of the discipline of the provider (i.e.dental, CHN, mental health, etc.). There is no limit to the number ofPOV's that can be entered for a patient for a given encounter.  At IHS facilities, POV's are generated automatically for this file attime of discharge from the Admission, Discharge and Transfer (ADT) system.POV's are entered in narrative form, and coded automatically to the appropriate ICD9 code. Physician entered narrative which modifies thediagnosis, such as ""doubtful, suspect, resolved"" are entered by the dataentry person in the MODIFIER field.  Narrative qualifiers, such as ""nothealing well"", ""date of onset"", ""severe"" etc.. are stored in the NARRATIVEQUALIFIER field.  STAGE is used only as a local option.  The file containspointers to the IHS Patient file, and visit file, and data must exist inboth of these files for this visit before a POV can be entered here. At VA facilities, POV is used as an abbreviation for ""Problem of Visit"",or the problem treated at the visit.  POV's are primarily createdfor clinic visits from 3 sources:  1) The scheduling checkout process, in which case the informationcollected about the POV is limited to the ICD Diagnosis code.  Theprovider narrative becomes the ICD narrative from the ICD Diagnosis file.  2) The Encounter Form automated data scanning (AICS package).  In thiscase the provider narrative is the terminology defined by the clinician torepresent the diagnosis on the encounter form. The AICS package, or otherautomated data capture tool, is able to pass the narrative and the ICDDiagnosis.  If the problem treated at the visit was a pre-existing problemfrom the patient's ""Problem List"", the related problem entry is alsostored in the POV record. (The Problem List orientation is not utilized byIHS.)  3) The manual data entry process for encounter form data not collectedvia automated data capture.  This process is the most like the process IHS"

996.09,IMPORT FILTERS,996,"The import filters section defines the rules for importing other entries in the file being edited.  The import function is a very useful tool, but can present a data security risk if not properly restricted.  The editor assumes that other entries in an edited file are inaccessible to the user unless an import filter has been defined for that file.  The import filter controls which entries a user sees and, therefore, can import.  This subfile contains two fields that associate a global root with an M expression that controls access to entries within the global."
